# A Simple Choice

This script is used to split a mail-merged certificate from a mac. 
Apple products have limited Microsoft Word abilities. 
One of its limitations occurs when attempting to Mail-Merge and automatically email the mail-merged output. 
Apple products do not allow you to proceed from here, but it does allow you to download a huge document with multiple certificates. 
"realscript.py" allows you to split this document. "convert.py" allows you to split this document and convert it into indivdual PDF's. 

# Current Use Case

My current use case for these scripts, is when I want to create certificates for trainings that have been completed at my job, 
  but I only have access to my Macbook Air. 
When I have my HP laptop, the script is not required as Office Suite has far stronger integration with actual Windows products.
